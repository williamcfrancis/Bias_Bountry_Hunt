If the pair is rejected, you can continue tuning hyperparameters or searching for new groups. If the pair is accepted, you can retrain a new *(g,h)* pair over ALL the training data, and submit this pair to the server for an update. This will allow you to \"squeeze all the juice\" from your training data and test potential updates much quicker.  "
